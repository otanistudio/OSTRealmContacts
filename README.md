# OSTRealmContacts

__Realm + AddressBook.framework__

## Wut?

[![YouTube Demo of OSTRealmContacts](http://img.youtube.com/vi/F1cPDV3YtFc/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/F1cPDV3YtFc)

This is an iOS Sample project that explores the importation of AddressBook contacts into a [Realm](http://realm.io) database using [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/), bridged with an Objective-C based wrapper of [ABAddressBook](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/AddressBook/Reference/ABAddressBookRef_iPhoneOS/index.html) called [RHAddressBook](https://github.com/heardrwt/RHAddressBook).

By default, the project uses an in-memory instance of Realm, but you can make a one-line change in `OSTABManager` to switch to a persisted, default Realm (so that you can, for example, check out the data in the [Realm Browser](http://realm.io/docs/cocoa/#realm-browser).)

### Features

* Imports data from Contacts.app into a Realm database
* Uses `UISearchController` and friends to display the results of predicate queries against the Realm instance
* Responds to Address Book change notifications and inserts/updates records (but doesn't yet delete them)
* This repo includes 1200 fake contacts to use in your dev environment. Just drag `fake_contacts_1200.vcf` onto your iOS Simulator.

## Why?

I did something similar in Objective-C, CoreData and `NSFetchedResultsController`. 

I wanted to learn more about Swift, gain a little bit of insight about bridging with ObjC, and play with Realm as a viable alternative to CoreData. I hope there's something others can learn here, and this provides a basis for me to learn back from all of you.

## Known Issues / TODOs

* The predicates for searching through large datasets need to be faster
* If you've already run the app, and you want to switch from in-memory to default Realm (or _vice-versa_) then you'll need to delete the app, as the two engines will conflict with each other.
* The app can crash when switching Contacts permissions while the app is running. This is related the way threads get stored inside an [RHAddressBook singleton](https://github.com/heardrwt/RHAddressBook/blob/master/RHAddressBook/RHAddressBookSharedServices.m). I haven't verified whether this also happens in an Objective-C based app. We can either address this in a fork, or look into newer Swift-based libraries like <https://github.com/a2/Gulliver>.
* Deleted records from the AddressBook don't sync across to the Realm databaseâ€¦ yet. 
* Writes for each record happen in a batch within a GCD concurrent queue, but this might need to happen in a more efficient manner. We'll know for sure when this is tested by a very popular person with 25K+ records ðŸ˜‡.
* While Swift makes prefix-style class namespacing "unnecessary," I still used the `OST` prefix as it still helped my brain think about the code.
* I ran into problems with the Swift compiler when trying to include the RHAddressbook lib as part of the build target, so I had to build a separate static lib and include it that way for now. This won't work on 32-bit iOS _Simulators_ (5, 4S) as there isn't a 32-bit slice for 386 in the prebuilt RHAddressBook "universal" static library, but it will run on actual 32-bit ARM devices (verified on an iPod Touch 5th Gen)

## Thanks!

[Realm](http://realm.io). A sweet mobile database engine.
